        <br/>

        </br>All characters are available in matches except Thelma Vayne who has been banned from tournament play through community vote.
        </br>
        </br>All stages are available in matches, including Fort Fiesta which was banned in tournament one through community vote. The stage for the first game will be choosen via <a href="StageRandomizer.html">random generator</a>, the stage for the second game will be chosen by the loser of the first game, and the stage for the third game (if necessary) will be Battle of Bandits.
        </br>
        </br>All weapons are available in matches, however there will be a weapon pick and ban system in place as follows:
        <br/>
        <br/>In the first and second games of a match, both teams will simultaneously:
        <br/>
        <br/>1. Ban a weapon combination,
        <br/>2. Pick a weapon combination,
        <br/>3. Ban a weapon combination,
        <br/>4. Pick a weapon combination,
        <br/>5. Ban a weapon combination,
        <br/>6. Pick a weapon combination
        <br/>
        <br/>While in the third match, both teams will simultaneously:
        <br/>
        <br/>1. Pick a weapon combination,
        <br/>2. Ban a weapon combination,
        <br/>3. Ban a weapon combination,
        <br/>4. Pick a weapon combination,
        <br/>5. Ban a weapon combination,
        <br/>6. Pick a weapon combination
        <br/>
        <br/>When a weapon combination is banned it can not be used by any member of the opposing team, when a weapon combination is picked, it can be used by only a single member of team. However, until a weapon combination has been banned by the opposing team, it can be picked multiple times by a team. 
        <br/>
        <br/>Exploits, such as, but not limited to sword whirlwind or intentionally crashing the game are banned in tournament play. Any bad faith attempt to circumnavigate these rules or engage in other acts of unfair play may result in automatic match losses or outright disqualification depending on the severity of the action, as determined on a case-by-case basis.
