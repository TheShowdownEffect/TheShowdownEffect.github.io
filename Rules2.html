        <!-- <p class="text-left text-white p-5">Welcome to the Showdown Effect Tournament!<br/>
        <br/> The first 32 members to <a href="https://forms.gle/Hxn8vLYfvpg8y9ps9">sign up<a> will be evenly (as can be) split into 8 teams of 4 players each, which can be viewed <a href="Teams1.html">here<a>. All skill and experience levels are welcome.
        <br/>
        <br/>If teams want to change their team's name they can contact me at the <a href="https://discord.gg/YFXqhad5dw">showdown effect discord<a> @GiuseppeIII.
        <br/>
        <br/> Each match between two teams in the <a href="Bracket1.html">bracket<a> will consist of up to three best of 7 matches. The first team to win two best of 7 matches will move to the next round of the tournament, while the losing team will either move to a different part of the bracket or be given a ranking as stipulated in the bracket.
        <br/>
        <br/> The tournament has been designed in a way so that each team will play at least 3 matches, with most teams playing 4-7 matches while also minimizing the times teams will play against a team they have previously faced.
        <br/>
        <br/> By placement, the exact breakdown of games played is:
        <br/> 1st Place: 4-5 Games
        <br/> 2nd Place: 6-7 Games
        <br/> 3rd Place: 4-5 Games
        <br/> 4th Place: 5-7 Games
        <br/> 5th Place: 5-7 Games
        <br/> 6th Place: 5-6 Games
        <br/> 7th Place: 4-5 Games
        <br/> 8th Place: 3 Games
        </br>
        <br/>Stages for each match will be randomly picked using the <a href="StageRandomizer.html">stage select</a> with default options (all stages except Fort Fiesta checked). With the stage randomizer being used between each of the best of 7 matches.
        <br/>
        <br/>Exploits, such as, but not limited to sword whirlwind and intentionally crashing the game are banned in tournament play and their usage by a member of a team will result in that team's immediate loss of the match used in. Furthermore, all team members must play with the names they signed up as or the above consequences will also apply. Any bad faith attempt to circumnavigate these rules or engage in other acts of unfair play may also result in automatic match losses or outright disqualification depending on the severity of the action, as determined on a case-by-case basis.
        <br/>
        <br/>Due to community vote, the character Thelma Vayne has been banned from tournament play. 
        <br/>
        <br/>We are still looking for people to stream/record/commentate matches.

Additionally, if anyone wants to sponsor the tournament or contribute to a tournament prize pool direct message me on discord @GiuseppeIII. Any other questions, comments, suggestions, etc. can be also asked on discord.

        <br/>Best of luck to all players and teams!<p/> -->

        </br>All weapons are available in matches, however there will be a weapon pick and ban system in place as follows:
        <br/>
        <br/>In the first and second games of a match, both teams will simultaneously:
        <br/>
        <br/>1. Ban a weapon combination,
        <br/>2. Ban a weapon combiantion,
        <br/>3. Pick a weapon combination,
        <br/>4. Pick a weapon combination,
        <br/>5. Ban a weapon combination,

        <br/>5. Ban a weapon combination,

However, until a weapon combination has been banned by the opposing team, it can be picked multiple times by a team.
